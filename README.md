# iDeep

we proposed a deep learning based framework, iDeep, to fuse heterogeneous data for predicting RNA-protein interaction sites. The deep learning framework can
not only learn the hidden feature patterns from individual source of data, but also extracted the shared representation across them. To validate our proposed method over state-of-the-art methods,
we perform experiments on large-scale CLIP-seq datasets. The comprehensive results indicated the huge advantage of iDeep, which performs much better than matrix factorization 
based method. <br><br>
